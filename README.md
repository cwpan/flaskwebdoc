# Python Flask Energy Consumption Predictor
Building a Python Flask Machine Learning project
In this project, we are going to use a linear regression algorithm  from scikit-learn library to help predict the brown coal consumption based on the historical UN energy statistics dataset. Flask light web framework will be use to diliver the analytic portal to the  public.
The dataset is from UN energy statistics dataset
