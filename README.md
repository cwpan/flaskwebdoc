# Python Flask Energy Consumption Predictor
In this project, we are going to use a linear regression algorithm  from scikit-learn library to help predict the brown coal consumption based on the historical UN energy statistics dataset. Flask light web framework will be use to diliver the analytic portal to the  public.
The dataset is from UN energy statistics dataset

# Overview
This project will be running as MVP to deliver minimum features by leverageing Machine learning model. The data process flow has no different with large scale of marchine learning by follow the processes below
- Data Exporation phase: Power BI Desktop edition was used for data exploration and data clearning. 
- Data Model Creation: Jupytor note book running on Azure compute node or Google Clab notebook was used
- Model deployment: AWS app runner
